# Product Backlog
Using Agile Methodology

## 1. User Stories - representing new functionality

	ADD A FEW MORE PICTURES TO SITE AND CONSIDER CHANGING HOW IT LOOKS IN THE GALLERY
	CHANGE LOOK A BIT AND ADD MORE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
	Modify sql with new table made by Natacha.  Add Stored Procedure.
	ALSO KEEP TRACK OF WHERE CAME FROM AND WHERE GOING.
	Make appropriate changes in emailconfirmation.php with two new files email.php, with its Email class and commentform.php with its CommentForm class.

## 2. Bugs – representing work to address a defect
      No known bugs.

## 3. Chores – representing work that must be done, but provide no direct business value


## 4. Epics – representing big user stories. Originally defined as too big to fit in an iteration (the equivalent of a Scrum sprint)

## 5. Prototypes (a form of risk mitigation) – representing proof of concepts that help provide information for decision making around whether some functionality may be valuable
